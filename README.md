## About

The goal of this plugin is to provide an **easy-to-use, customizable and extensible** way to create dialogues without having to build your own system, because depending on the game, it can be a huge and complex task.

I started making this dialogue system for my game [One Cake Day](https://kazymila.itch.io/one-cake-day), and future projects, but then it became an entire editor (...and a year of work!), so I decided to make it a full plugin! I hope it helps you build your narrative more easily and improve your workflow!

_Follow my game on Itch.io! (It's on early stages yet)_
