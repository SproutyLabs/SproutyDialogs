## About

The goal of this plugin is to provide an **easy-to-use, customizable and extensible** way to create dialogues without having to build your own system, because depending on the game, can be a huge and complex task.

I started making this dialogue system for my game [One Cake Day](https://kazymila.itch.io/one-cake-day), and future projects, but then it became an entire editor (...and a year of work!), so I decided to make it a full plugin! I hope it helps you build your narrative more easily and improve your workflow!

*Follow my game on Itch.io! (It's on early stages yet)*

## Documentation

You can see the [documentation](https://SproutyLabs.github.io/SproutyDialogsDocs) for learn more about Sprouty Dialogs and all its features!

There is a [getting started](https://SproutyLabs.github.io/SproutyDialogsDocs/docs/category/getting-started) section, where you can learn how to start making your dialogues!

Also, you have a [class reference](https://SproutyLabs.github.io/SproutyDialogsDocs/docs/category/class-reference) is you need it.

## Roadmap

These are some features that I want to implement in the future:

- [ ] Typing sounds support
- [ ] Adding more event nodes:
  - [ ] Randomize node
  - [ ] Play sound node
  - [ ] Switch case node
- [ ] Text effect tags to handle dialogues, such as change the typing speed

And I will probably add more as I needed for my game ;)

Wharever, you can also contribute and add your own features, so please feel free to do so!
